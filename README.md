#  Aircraft Risk Scoring & Safety Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation incident data determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.  It has identified aircraft models with zero injury rates and evaluated risk patterns. The  main goal is to support better decision-making in aviation safety and fleet expansion.

##  Files Included
- `Aircraft Risk Scoring & Safety Analysis - Jupyter Notebook.pdf` – Main analysis notebook in PDF format
- `cleaned_aviation_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for analysis
- `Presentation .pdf` – Summary presentation of the findings
- `Phase 1- Tableau Project.twbx(Diana Aloo).twbx` – Tableau dashboard file for data visualization

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau
- PowerPoint
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas

##  Key Insights
- Identified aircraft models with zero injuries across all incident records
- Highlighted high-risk models and patterns based on total injuries
- Developed visual dashboards for clearer safety analysis
