#  Aircraft Risk Scoring & Safety Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation incident data determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.  It has identified aircraft models with zero injury rates and evaluated risk patterns. The  main goal is to support better decision-making in aviation safety and fleet expansion.
Aircraft Risk Analysis for Business Expansion
## Business Understanding
As part of our company’s strategic move to diversify its portfolio, I was tasked with analyzing the risks associated with operating various aircraft models. With the aviation division exploring opportunities in both commercial and private aviation sectors, one critical question emerged:

Which aircraft types pose the least risk and are the safest to invest in?

This analysis aims to answer that question using historical aviation incident data. My goal is to identify which aircraft types have the lowest recorded incidents and fatalities to help make informed, data-driven decisions as we plan to enter the aviation industry.

By the end of this project, I provide:

A clear overview of aviation safety trends.
Insights into which aircraft types have historically demonstrated low risk.
Strategic, data-backed recommendations to guide aircraft purchasing decisions.
This analysis is designed to be visually intuitive, business-focused, and actionable for the head of the aviation division and other key stakeholders.

##  Key Insights
- Identified aircraft models with zero injuries across all incident records
- Highlighted high-risk models and patterns based on total injuries
- Developed visual dashboards for clearer safety analysis
## Data Understanding
Before making any recommendations, I needed to understand the dataset in detail that is what kind of data we’re working with, what it tells us, and what limitations it might have.

The dataset includes records of aviation-related events over the years, and each row represents a reported aircraft incident. It contains details such as the type of aircraft, number of fatalities, the location of the incident, and the aircraft category.

Understanding this data allows us to answer:

What types of aircraft have the most and least incidents?
Are there certain models or categories that are consistently high- or low-risk?
Are there missing values that could impact the reliability of our analysis?
This step ensures I’m building insights on solid, clean data that can be trusted for high-stakes decisions like aircraft acquisition.

## Recommendations
Based on the comprehensive data analysis including injury aggregation, annual trend analysis, accident severity breakdown, and a custom Aircraft Risk Scoring Model I made the following data-backed recommendations :

1. Prioritize Zero-Injury Aircraft Models
Aircraft models that consistently show zero reported injuries (fatal, serious, or minor) in our dataset stand out as the safest and most reliable. These models were highlighted in our "Top 10 Zero-Injury Models" bar chart and should be prioritized for:

Fleet expansion or leasing decisions
Routes requiring high safety assurance
Minimizing insurance and maintenance costs
These aircraft represent low operational risk and high public trust.

2. Deploy Low-Risk Models for Controlled Operations
Aircraft falling into the Low Risk category in our Risk Scoring Model demonstrate minimal injury occurrences despite recorded incidents. They are best suited for:

Short-haul or regional routes
Low-density or lower-risk environments
Operations with enhanced monitoring and preventive maintenance
These models offer acceptable safety margins when managed properly.

3. Avoid High-Risk Aircraft with Severe Injury Records
Our bar chart of top 20 risk-scored aircraft models clearly identifies planes with elevated injury scores, driven by high fatal or serious injury counts. These models pose:

Reputational risk
Higher legal and regulatory scrutiny
Costlier insurance and compliance overhead
These aircraft are not advisable for acquisition or continued use.

Supporting Visuals
The following notebook visualizations support and validate these recommendations:

Total Injuries by Aircraft Model – reveals models with the most injuries
Annual Accident Trend Line – tracks safety progress over time
Accident Severity Pie Chart – illustrates severity distribution
Zero-Injury Aircraft Chart – highlights safest models
Risk Scoring Bar Chart – classifies aircraft by risk tier
Strategic Value for Stakeholders
By adopting these recommendations grounded in data science and risk modeling:

Operational Safety is improved
Insurance and maintenance costs can be reduced
Customer confidence is strengthened
Supports a data-driven, safety-first brand narrative
